    <section id="History">
        <h2> History </h2>
        <p>Founded in 1982, White Water Adventures Company has grown from a small local
            business to one of the most respected names in adventure tourism.
            Our journey began when Jean and Julia Jones decided to turn their passion for
            rafting into a profession. With a commitment to safety, excitement, and environmental
            stewardship, we have been offering unforgettable rafting experiences for over
             40 years</p>

        <p> In the early days, our operations were limited to a few local rivers. However,
            as word of our exceptional service and thrilling adventures spread, we
            expanded our offerings to include a variety of rivers and rafting experiences
            suitable for all skill levels. Our guides, are highly trained professionals
            dedicated to ensuring that every trip is both safe and exhilarating</p>

             <p>Over the years, we have invested in the latest equipments and training
                to maintain the highest standards of safety and customer satisfaction. Our
                commitment to the environment has also led us to implement sustainable
                practices, ensuring that the natural beauty of rivers we raft is preserved
                for future generations </p>

                <p>Today, White Water Adventures Company is proud to be a leader in the 
                    adventure tourism industry, offering a range of trips that cater to
                    both beginners and experienced rafters.
